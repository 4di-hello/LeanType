# LeanType GIF Plugin

Rich media and GIF search plugin for [LeanType Keyboard](https://github.com/LeanBitLab/LeanType).

## Overview

This plugin provides fast, out-of-process media search and retrieval (GIFs, Stickers, Memes, and Animated Emojis) for the LeanType Keyboard via an IPC AIDL contract (`IGifEngine`) and thumbnail ContentProvider (`com.leanbitlab.leantype.gif.thumbs`).

## Architecture

- **Engine Service**: Out-of-process AIDL service running in isolated namespace `com.leanbitlab.leantype.gif`
- **AIDL Interface**: `com.leanbitlab.leantype.gif.IGifEngine` (Contract v2)
- **Service Action**: `com.leanbitlab.leantype.gif.ENGINE`
- **Thumbnail Provider**: `com.leanbitlab.leantype.gif.thumbs` (read-only ContentProvider with magic-byte validation)
- **Security**:
  - **Bi-directional SHA-256 certificate pinning**: The host keyboard verifies the plugin signature, and the plugin enforces caller UID package name and certificate verification (`CallerCheck`).
  - **Encrypted credential storage**: API keys are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM backed by the Android Keystore (`CredentialStore`).
  - **Strict single-ownership PFD streaming**: Media files are passed to the host via read-only `ParcelFileDescriptor` to prevent memory bloat on the keyboard process.
  - **Header validation**: Thumbnails and media files are verified for genuine GIF, WebP, PNG, or JPEG file headers.

## ✨ Features

- **🎬 Multi-Category Rich Media**: Search and browse across GIFs, Stickers, Memes, and Animated Emojis.
- **🕒 Universal Recent Tab**: Quick access to your recently sent GIFs and stickers across all providers.
- **📁 100% Offline Local Media**: Import and browse your own GIF, WebP, PNG files, and ZIP sticker packs with zero internet required.
- **🔄 Multi-Provider Support**: Seamless support for **GIPHY**, **KLIPY**, and **Local Media**, with 1-tap provider switching directly from the search bar badge.
- **🛡️ Secure API Key Vault**: Your personal API keys are encrypted at rest with hardware-backed Android Keystore keys and never shared outside the plugin process.
- **⚡ Zero-Memory Overhead**: Files are streamed directly to target apps using Android commitContent APIs and read-only file descriptors, keeping keyboard input responsive and smooth.
- **🔋 Battery & Resource Optimized**: Runs in a separate process that automatically disconnects and unbinds when the GIF picker is closed.
- **🔄 Universal Compatibility**: Compatible across **all LeanType flavors** (`Standard`, `Offline`, etc.).

## 📋 System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Android 6.0 (API 23) or higher
- **Host Keyboard**: [LeanType](https://github.com/LeanBitLab/LeanType) v4.2.9+ (All flavors)
- **Permissions**: Internet permission (`android.permission.INTERNET`) to query provider APIs and download media
