## 🚀 LeanType 4.2.8

---

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Android 12 Crash Loop on Keypress**: Resolved a fatal `NoSuchMethodError` crash loop on Android 12 (API 31/32) caused by `VibrationAttributes.createForUsage` (introduced in API 33), restoring smooth typing on affected devices.
- **Vibration Intensity Slider**: Restored vibration amplitude scaling when custom intensity is set, resolving an issue where the haptic slider only operated at full intensity or off on certain devices.
- **Crash Log Reporting in Release Builds**: Hardened crash report generation to use reliable internal storage and exposed internal crash reports in settings dialogs across release builds.

### ✨ Added
- **Auto-Capitalization Toolbar Controls & JSON Actions**: Added optional toolbar buttons, pinned controls, and custom JSON layout key mappings for toggling auto-capitalization and force auto-capitalization, with real-time state refresh and accessible screen reader descriptions.
- **Comprehensive Global Translations**: Reached 100% complete translation coverage across 25 target languages and regional variants for all recent settings and UI strings.
